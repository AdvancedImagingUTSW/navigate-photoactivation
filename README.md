**navigate-photoactivation** is a plugin for [navigate](https://github.
com/TheDeanLab/navigate), the open-source Python package designed for the control of 
light-sheet microscopes. **navigate** offers easily reconfigurable hardware setups 
and automated acquisition routines, making it a powerful tool for advanced imaging 
techniques.

With **navigate-photoactivation**, users can perform targeted photo-stimulation of 
optogenetic biosensors, execute localization microscopy routines, and conduct 
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and photo-switching experiments. 
The plugin allows these processes to be performed in response to user-specified 
criteria, enhancing the flexibility and precision of your imaging experiments.
